Perfect. Let me create a summary document of my audit findings:

## AUDIT SUMMARY

### Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE AND CORRECT

#### 1. **Meaningful Progress** ✅
The agent successfully implemented the entire feature as specified:
- **Section 12 (DASHBOARD)** added to `scripts/cct-doctor.sh` (lines 703-802)
- Comprehensive test suite created: `scripts/cct-doctor-test.sh` (238 lines, 14 tests)
- All acceptance criteria met and verified

#### 2. **Code Quality** ✅
- **Bash 3.2 compatible**: No associative arrays, `readarray`, or unsupported features
- **Pipefail safe**: All grep commands properly guarded in `if` conditions (lines 787-792)
- **Error handling**: Proper command substitution and variable scoping throughout
- **Helper usage**: Correctly uses `check_pass()`, `check_warn()`, `check_fail()` helpers
- **Variable integration**: Properly increments `PASS`, `WARN`, `FAIL` counters; summary section automatically picks them up

#### 3. **No Incomplete Work** ✅
- **Zero TODOs/FIXMEs**: No placeholder code or unfinished markers
- **Clean git status**: Only loop logs modified (expected)
- **Fully wired**: Tests are part of `npm test` pipeline

#### 4. **No Regressions** ✅
- All 14 doctor-specific tests pass ✓
- All 171 other tests in the suite pass (185 total) ✓
- Doctor script runs cleanly and shows correct output with DASHBOARD section
- No impact on existing checks

#### 5. **Acceptance Criteria Met** ✅

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Bun check with install instructions | ✅ | Lines 710-716; test passes |
| Dashboard file existence verified | ✅ | Lines 719-765; test passes |
| Port 8767 availability checked | ✅ | Lines 767-802; test passes |
| Fallback chain (lsof/ss/netstat) | ✅ | Lines 782-794; test passes |
| Tests part of `npm test` | ✅ | All 14 doctor tests passing |

#### 6. **Design Alignment** ✅
All design decisions implemented correctly:
- ✅ Bun runtime detection with version display
- ✅ Three-path search for `server.ts` (repo/XDG/legacy)
- ✅ Individual asset validation (index.html, app.js, styles.css)
- ✅ PID file check before port probe
- ✅ Port check with lsof→ss→netstat fallback chain
- ✅ Warnings for optional features (dashboard is not required)
- ✅ Hard fails for truly broken setup, warnings for missing optional components

#### 7. **Security & Best Practices** ✅
- No command injection vulnerabilities
- Proper output redirection (`2>/dev/null`)
- Safe variable expansion (all quoted)
- No use of `eval` or similar risky patterns
- Atomic operations for file checks

---

**AUDIT_PASS**

The implementation is production-ready and fully meets the specification. All code quality standards are maintained, all tests pass, and there are no regressions or incomplete work.
