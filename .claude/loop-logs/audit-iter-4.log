Perfect! I've thoroughly reviewed the implementation. Let me now compile the complete audit:

## Audit Summary

### Implementation Quality: ✅ EXCELLENT

**Critical Checklist:**

1. **Meaningful Progress Toward Goal** ✅
   - The agent implemented a complete `dry_run_summary()` function that renders a formatted table showing estimated durations and costs for each enabled pipeline stage
   - The implementation fully satisfies the design specification

2. **No Obvious Bugs** ✅
   - All `jq` and `grep` calls are properly guarded with `2>/dev/null` and `|| true` to satisfy `pipefail` (lines 974, 978, 1010, 1018, 1037)
   - Model resolution correctly implements the hierarchy: CLI > stage config > defaults > "opus" (line 1010-1012)
   - Median calculation uses correct formula `(count + 1) / 2` (lines 1022, 1041)
   - Cost arithmetic uses `awk` for proper floating-point precision (line 1046)
   - File existence checks before accessing `$EVENTS_FILE` (lines 1016, 1035)
   - Non-numeric duration values are explicitly rejected with regex validation (line 1025)

3. **No Incomplete Work** ✅
   - No TODO, FIXME, XXX, or HACK markers in the dry-run code
   - All validation criteria from the design document are implemented
   - Three comprehensive test cases are properly registered and passing

4. **No Regressions** ✅
   - All 184 tests pass across 11 test suites (17+12+13+27+22+14+21+15+12+17+14)
   - The three new dry-run tests all pass individually:
     - `test_dry_run`: Basic dry-run with no artifacts
     - `test_dry_run_summary_with_history`: Seeded events produce correct medians and totals
     - `test_dry_run_summary_no_history`: Graceful fallback to "no data" / "—"
   - No existing tests were broken

5. **Code Quality** ✅
   - **Bash 3.2 Compatible**: No associative arrays, `readarray`, or lowercase/uppercase modifiers
   - **Proper Error Handling**: All external command chains are guarded; missing events file handled gracefully
   - **Clean Logic**: Median calculation is mathematically correct; model resolution follows design hierarchy
   - **Readable**: Clear section comments (e.g., "── Model resolution ──"), well-structured loops
   - **Consistent with Codebase**: Follows existing patterns (early `|| true` guards, `info()` output helper)

6. **Alignment with Design** ✅
   - ✅ Reads enabled stages from pipeline template via `jq` (line 974)
   - ✅ Computes median duration per stage from `stage.completed` events (line 1018)
   - ✅ Computes median cost per stage from `cost.record` events (line 1037)
   - ✅ Resolves model per stage with correct hierarchy (line 1010)
   - ✅ Renders Unicode box-drawing table with fixed column widths (lines 989-1083)
   - ✅ Shows budget remaining via `cct-cost.sh remaining-budget` (line 1087)
   - ✅ Zero side effects (early return at line 4087, before `run_pipeline()`)
   - ✅ Graceful fallback for missing history (lines 1015, 1034)

7. **Test Coverage** ✅
   - Events backup/restore in test setup/teardown (lines 47-52)
   - All three test cases registered in runner array (lines 935-937)
   - Cost assertions correctly use single quotes for patterns (avoids `$0` expansion in double quotes)
   - Cleanup correctly captures result to avoid masking assertion failures (line 846, variable `rc`)

### Design Adherence: ✅ COMPLETE

The implementation matches every requirement from the ADR:
- Data flow from CLI to `dry_run_summary()` is correct
- Median selection for timing/cost (right-skewed distribution handling)
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- No new dependencies

**AUDIT_PASS**

The work demonstrates excellent quality with complete implementation, comprehensive testing, and no regressions. The agent successfully delivered the feature as designed.
