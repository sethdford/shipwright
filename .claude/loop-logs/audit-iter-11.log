Perfect. The agent's work is complete and properly committed. Let me create one final summary:

## AUDIT SUMMARY

I've completed a comprehensive code audit of the agent's work on the "shipwright doctor should validate dashboard dependencies and port availability" feature. Here are my findings:

### ✅ MEANINGFUL PROGRESS
The agent successfully **completed the entire implementation** as specified in the design document:

**Implementation (scripts/cct-doctor.sh Section 12 — Lines 703–802):**
- Bun runtime detection with install instructions when missing
- Dashboard server.ts location search across 3 paths (repo, ~/.local/share, ~/.shipwright)
- Public asset validation (index.html, app.js, styles.css)
- Port 8767 availability check with lsof→ss→netstat fallback chain
- PID file check (~/.claude-teams/dashboard.pid) with stale detection

**Tests (scripts/cct-doctor-test.sh — 14 dedicated tests):**
- All tests pass
- Wired into `npm test` (package.json)
- Covers structure, dependencies, port checks, and smoke tests
- Full test suite: 185 tests pass (14 doctor + 171 others)

### ✅ NO BUGS OR LOGIC ERRORS
- **Bash syntax**: Valid (bash -n passes)
- **Bash 3.2 compatible**: No associative arrays, readarray, or case transformations
- **Pipeline safe**: set -euo pipefail, all external commands properly guarded
- **Error handling**: All grep commands wrapped in `if` statements, no unguarded subshell exits
- **Path handling**: Correct directory resolution, tilde expansion in output
- **PID file path**: Consistent with cct-dashboard.sh (${HOME}/.claude-teams/dashboard.pid)
- **Port check logic**: Correct fallback chain, PORT_IN_USE variable proper initialization
- **Design compliance**: Correct severity levels (warnings, not failures) for optional features

### ✅ NO INCOMPLETE WORK
- No TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX markers
- All acceptance criteria met
- Code follows established project patterns
- No placeholder code or stub implementations

### ✅ NO REGRESSIONS
- No modifications to unrelated scripts
- All existing doctor checks still pass
- Summary section correctly includes new PASS/WARN/FAIL counts
- No changes to helper functions (check_pass/check_warn/check_fail)

### ✅ CODE QUALITY ACCEPTABLE
- Clean, readable implementation following project conventions
- Proper variable scoping and naming
- Consistent with other doctor sections
- Comprehensive test coverage with 14 distinct test cases
