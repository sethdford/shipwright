Perfect! Everything checks out. Let me write a comprehensive summary of my findings:

## Summary of Audit

I have conducted a thorough code review of the autonomous agent's implementation of the `--json` output flag for the `shipwright status` command. Here are my findings:

### Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The feature has been **fully implemented, tested, and verified**. The branch is at the same state as main (only loop logs differ locally).

### Code Quality: ✅ EXCELLENT

**Strengths:**
1. **Bash 3.2 Compatibility**: No Bash 4+ features detected; follows project standards
2. **Error Handling**: Proper jq dependency check with JSON error output to stderr + exit 1
3. **JSON Safety**: Uses `jq --arg/--argjson` for proper escaping (not string interpolation)
4. **Cross-Platform**: Date parsing works on macOS (`date -j`) and Linux (`date -d`)
5. **No Code Markers**: Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX markers
6. **Version Variable**: Properly included per conventions
7. **Clean Design**: Separate JSON vs human-readable code paths prevent regression

### Test Coverage: ✅ COMPREHENSIVE

**All 12 tests passing:**
1. JSON output is valid JSON
2. JSON has all six top-level keys
3. Empty state returns correct defaults
4. Timestamp is ISO 8601 format
5. Teams populated from tmux
6. Tasks populated from mock files
7. Daemon populated from state file
8. Heartbeats populated from files
9. Machines populated from file
10. --help flag works and documents --json
11. Human output unchanged (regression test)
12. Missing jq exits with error

**Test Quality:**
- Proper mocking of tmux, file system, and PATH
- Isolation with temporary directories
- Proper cleanup (no leftover artifacts)
- Wired into `npm test` suite
- All 130+ total npm tests pass

### Schema Compliance: ✅ MATCHES DESIGN SPEC

The JSON output structure matches the design specification exactly:
- `timestamp`: ISO 8601 format ✓
- `teams`: Array of {name, panes, status, session} ✓
- `tasks`: Object {completed, in_progress, pending} ✓
- `daemon`: Object or null ✓
- `heartbeats`: Array with alive detection ✓
- `machines`: Array from registry ✓

### Acceptance Criteria: ✅ ALL MET

- ✓ `shipwright status --json | jq .` produces valid JSON
- ✓ All six top-level keys present
- ✓ Timestamp is ISO 8601
- ✓ Empty state returns correct defaults
- ✓ Data sections populate correctly
- ✓ Human output unchanged
- ✓ jq missing error handling works
- ✓ --help documents feature

### No Issues Found

The implementation is production-ready with:
- No logic errors
- No regressions
- No incomplete work
- No security vulnerabilities
- No code quality violations
