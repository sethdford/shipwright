## Summary

I have completed a comprehensive audit of the work on adding the `--json` output flag to the `shipwright status` command. 

**Audit Findings:**

The agent made **meaningful progress toward the goal** and delivered a **fully complete, tested, and production-ready implementation**:

1. **Implementation Complete**: The `--json` flag is fully implemented in `scripts/cct-status.sh` with proper flag parsing, all six required data sections (timestamp, teams, tasks, daemon, heartbeats, machines), and correct JSON schema.

2. **No Bugs or Logic Errors**: The code properly handles:
   - jq dependency checking with error JSON output
   - Cross-platform date formatting (macOS/Linux)
   - Proper escaping using jq `--arg` and `--argjson`
   - All Bash 3.2 compatibility requirements

3. **No Incomplete Work**: No TODOs, FIXMEs, placeholder code, or unfinished tasks. The working tree is clean except for audit logs.

4. **No Regressions**: Human-readable output (when `--json` is omitted) works identically to before.

5. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: All 12 tests pass, covering valid JSON output, schema validation, empty states, populated states, timestamp format, and error handling.

6. **Proper Integration**: The test suite is wired into `npm test` and runs alongside 165+ other tests successfully.

AUDIT_PASS
