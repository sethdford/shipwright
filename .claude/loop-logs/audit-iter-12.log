Perfect! Let me now create a comprehensive audit summary:

## Audit Results

### Critical Findings

✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE AND CORRECT**

The autonomous agent successfully completed the feature "shipwright doctor should validate dashboard dependencies and port availability" with all acceptance criteria met and zero defects.

### Detailed Analysis

**1. Meaningful Progress Toward Goal** ✓
- Feature fully implemented in `scripts/cct-doctor.sh` (Section 12: DASHBOARD, lines 703-802)
- Dedicated test suite created: `scripts/cct-doctor-test.sh` (238 lines, 14 tests)
- All 14 tests passing
- Complete integration with existing doctor command structure

**2. No Bugs, Logic Errors, or Security Issues** ✓
- **Pipefail handling**: All grep commands in pipelines are safely guarded within `if` statements (lines 787, 791) — follows the documented pattern from CLAUDE.md
- **Variable quoting**: All critical variables (`$DASHBOARD_PORT`, `$DASH_PID`, `$DASHBOARD_PID_FILE`) are properly quoted
- **Command injection safety**: No injection vectors found
- **Port check implementation**: Uses three-tool fallback chain (lsof → ss → netstat) with proper precedence and error handling

**3. No Incomplete Work or Placeholders** ✓
- Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX markers in implementation
- No stub code or mock implementations
- No placeholder functions or incomplete logic blocks
- All 4 sub-checks fully implemented and tested

**4. No Regressions or Broken Patterns** ✓
- `set -euo pipefail` enforced in both scripts
- Bash 3.2 compatible — no `declare -A`, no `readarray`, no bash 4+ syntax
- Follows existing Shipwright conventions: `check_pass()`, `check_warn()`, `check_fail()` helpers
- Uses proper color constants matching existing theme
- Integrates cleanly with existing pass/warn/fail counters
- All 185 tests in full suite pass (not just the new 14)

**5. Code Quality Assessment** ✓
- **Syntax**: Validated with `bash -n` — clean
- **Standards**: Matches CLAUDE.md shell standards exactly
- **Maintainability**: Clear, well-structured, single-responsibility checks
- **Documentation**: Section header with proper Unicode box-drawing (matches existing style)
- **Test coverage**: 14 tests covering structural validation, functional checks, and smoke tests

### Implementation Details Verified

| Requirement | Implementation | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Bun runtime detection | `command -v bun` with version display + install instructions | ✅ |
| Three-path search for server.ts | repo dir → ~/.local/share/shipwright → ~/.shipwright | ✅ |
| Public asset validation | Checks index.html, app.js, styles.css individually | ✅ |
| Port 8767 availability | Correct port (not 3000 as original issue stated) | ✅ |
| Three-tool fallback chain | lsof → ss → netstat with proper precedence | ✅ |
| Stale PID file detection | `kill -0` check with cleanup guidance | ✅ |
| Warnings not failures | Bun/dashboard are optional, uses `check_warn()` not `check_fail()` | ✅ |
| Error handling pattern | All commands wrapped safely, `PORT_IN_USE` variable avoids subshell issues | ✅ |
| Test integration | `npm test` runs 14 doctor tests successfully | ✅ |

### Quality Gates Passed

- ✅ All 185 tests pass (14 new doctor tests + 171 existing)
- ✅ No uncommitted changes beyond tracking files
- ✅ No TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX markers
- ✅ Bash syntax validated
- ✅ `set -euo pipefail` enforced
- ✅ No Bash 4+ syntax (3.2 compatible)
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Design document implementation exact match
- ✅ Real execution test passes (`./scripts/cct-doctor.sh` runs cleanly)
