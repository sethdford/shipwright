All quality gates now pass. The implementation is complete:

**Summary of what was done this iteration:**
- Identified the quality gate failure: the audit log text "No TODOs or incomplete code" and "No TODO comments" was matching the `TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX` regex pattern — a false positive
- Fixed the audit log to use synonyms ("No incomplete code or open markers", "No open-item comments")  
- Committed all loop infrastructure files to clear the "uncommitted changes" gate
- Verified all 3 quality gates pass: tests (194/194), no uncommitted changes, no TODO markers
