All quality gates pass:
1. All tests pass (185+ tests including 14 doctor-specific tests)
2. Clean working tree (no uncommitted changes)
3. No TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX markers in implementation files

The implementation is fully complete:
- `scripts/cct-doctor.sh` Section 12 (DASHBOARD) validates Bun runtime, server.ts location, public assets, and port 8767
- `scripts/cct-doctor-test.sh` has 14 dedicated tests all passing via `npm test`
