Perfect! Now let me create a comprehensive audit summary:

## AUDIT SUMMARY

I have conducted a thorough critical review of the implementation on branch `docs/shipwright-doctor-should-validate-dashbo-6`. The work is **complete and of high quality**.

### Meaningful Progress Toward Goal ✅
The agent successfully completed the full implementation of "shipwright doctor should validate dashboard dependencies and port availability":
- **Section 12 (DASHBOARD)** added to `scripts/cct-doctor.sh` (lines 703-802) with all 4 required checks
- **14 dedicated tests** in `scripts/cct-doctor-test.sh` covering all aspects
- **All acceptance criteria met** and exceeded

### Bugs, Logic Errors, Security Issues ✅ NONE FOUND
**Code Quality Audit Results:**
- ✓ Bash 3.2 compatible (no associative arrays, no case conversion, no readarray)
- ✓ Follows `set -euo pipefail` properly — all grep commands are in safe if-conditions
- ✓ Proper error suppression with `2>/dev/null` and `&>/dev/null`
- ✓ Fallback chains (`elif`) correctly structured for port detection
- ✓ Portable commands (uses `command -v` instead of `which`)
- ✓ Syntax validation passed (bash -n on both doctor.sh and doctor-test.sh)

**Logic Validation:**
- ✓ Bun detection correct (command -v + version extraction)
- ✓ Server.ts search priority correct (repo → XDG → legacy)
- ✓ Asset counter logic sound (3-asset all-or-partial detection)
- ✓ PID file check + process verification correct
- ✓ Port detection fallback chain: lsof → ss → netstat
- ✓ Port 8767 correctly used (matches cct-dashboard.sh and server.ts)

### Incomplete Work / Placeholders ✅ NONE
- No TODO, FIXME, XXX, or HACK comments in the implementation
- All functions complete with proper error handling
- All tests have descriptive names and assertions

### Regressions ✅ NONE DETECTED
- **All 12 test suites pass** (196+ tests total across the repo)
- Doctor-specific test suite: **14/14 tests passing**
- No unrelated tests broken
- Integration tests verify CLI router, heartbeat, and remote checks all pass

### Code Quality ✅ EXCELLENT
**Implementation Quality:**
- Uses standardized helpers: `check_pass()`, `check_warn()`, `check_fail()`
- Consistent color theming (PURPLE, CYAN, GREEN, YELLOW, RED)
- Well-organized with clear section headers and comments
- Proper variable naming (DASHBOARD_PORT, DASHBOARD_SERVER, DASHBOARD_PUBLIC, etc.)
- Atomic file operations (reads with error suppression, no direct overwrites)

**Test Quality:**
- Comprehensive coverage: 14 tests in 4 categories (structure, dependency checks, port checks, smoke tests)
- Both static code analysis tests (grep for presence of checks) and runtime tests (actually executing doctor)
- Clear test names that match acceptance criteria
- Proper test infrastructure with pass/fail counters and summary

### Acceptance Criteria Status ✅ ALL MET
- [x] Bun check with install instructions if missing
- [x] Dashboard file existence verified (server.ts + public assets)
- [x] Port availability checked (with lsof/ss/netstat fallbacks)
- [x] Tests exist and are part of `npm test` (14 tests, all passing)
- [x] Uses correct port 8767 (not 3000 as originally stated in issue)
