Everything works perfectly:

1. `--json` outputs valid JSON with all 6 required top-level keys: `timestamp`, `teams`, `tasks`, `daemon`, `heartbeats`, `machines`
2. Empty state has correct defaults (`[]` arrays, `null` daemon)
3. `--help` prints usage and exits 0
4. All 12 test suites pass (166+ tests)
5. The heartbeat from the current pipeline run is correctly detected

The implementation is complete and all quality gates pass. Let me do a final self-audit:

1. **Does the implementation FULLY satisfy the goal?** Yes - `--json` flag added to `shipwright status` with all specified data sections
2. **Edge cases handled?** Yes - missing jq, no tmux, no daemon, empty state, cross-platform date parsing
3. **TODO/FIXME/HACK comments?** None in new code
4. **All new code tested?** Yes - 12 tests covering validity, keys, empty state, timestamp, all 5 data sections, help, regression, and error handling
5. **Code reviewer would approve?** Yes - follows established patterns, safe `jq --arg`, Bash 3.2 compatible
6. **Clean and well-structured?** Yes - clean conditional branching, no regression risk on human output path

LOOP_COMPLETE
