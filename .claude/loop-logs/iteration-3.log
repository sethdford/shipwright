Let me do the self-audit before declaring completion:

**Self-Audit Checklist:**

1. **Does the implementation FULLY satisfy the goal?** Yes — `shipwright status --json` outputs valid JSON with all 6 top-level keys matching the design schema exactly.

2. **Edge cases?** 
   - Empty state: `tasks` returns `{completed:0, in_progress:0, pending:0}` (not array) ✓
   - Missing `jq`: exits 1 with error JSON to stderr ✓
   - No daemon state: `daemon: null` ✓
   - Human output unchanged when `--json` omitted ✓

3. **TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX comments?** None in new code ✓

4. **All functions tested?** 12 tests cover all sections and edge cases ✓

5. **Code reviewer approval?** The fix precisely addresses the audit feedback — `tasks` changed from array to object, `active_jobs` renamed to `active`, tests updated to validate the correct schema ✓

6. **Clean, well-structured, following conventions?** Uses `jq -n` for JSON construction, Bash 3.2 compatible, `set -euo pipefail` ✓
