Perfect! Based on my comprehensive audit, I can now provide my final assessment:

## Audit Summary

I have thoroughly reviewed the implementation of "shipwright doctor should validate dashboard dependencies and port availability" and found:

### Meaningful Progress
✅ **Complete implementation** — The feature is fully implemented exactly as specified in the design document. All acceptance criteria are met.

### No Bugs or Logic Errors
✅ **Robust error handling:**
- All `grep` commands are properly guarded under `set -euo pipefail`
- PID file check safely handles race conditions via `kill -0` in conditional
- `PORT_IN_USE` flag properly initialized before fallback chain
- All edge cases handled (empty PID, port in use, missing paths, partial assets)

✅ **Code quality:**
- Bash 3.2 compatible (no associative arrays, `readarray`, or modern expansions)
- Uses standardized `check_pass`/`check_warn` helpers consistently
- Proper variable quoting throughout
- Path handling uses `$HOME` with proper abbreviation

### No Incomplete Work
✅ **No TODO markers, placeholder code, or incomplete sections**
✅ **14 dedicated tests all passing** (verified via `npm test`)
✅ **All 185 total tests pass** — no regressions

### Security Validation
✅ No command injection vulnerabilities
✅ No unguarded shell expansions
✅ Proper error handling prevents silent failures

### Integration Quality
✅ Consistent with existing doctor script patterns
✅ Dashboard checks integrate seamlessly with pass/warn/fail summary
✅ No changes to other files or scripts
✅ Output includes actionable guidance (install commands, cleanup steps)
