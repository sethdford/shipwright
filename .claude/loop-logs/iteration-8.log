## Self-Audit Checklist

1. **Does the implementation FULLY satisfy the goal?** Yes — `shipwright status --json` produces valid JSON with all 6 required keys (timestamp, teams, tasks, daemon, heartbeats, machines), `--help` works, and the human output path is unchanged.

2. **Edge cases handled?** Yes — empty state (no tmux, no tasks, no daemon), missing jq, malformed JSON files, missing directories, cross-platform date parsing.

3. **TODO/FIXME/HACK comments?** None in new code.

4. **All new code tested?** Yes — 12 tests in `cct-status-test.sh` covering JSON validity, schema keys, empty state, timestamp format, all 5 data sections, help flag, regression, and missing jq.

5. **Code reviewer would approve?** Yes — follows established patterns (sandboxed tests, `jq --arg` for safe JSON, conditional branching), Bash 3.2 compatible, no regressions.

6. **Clean and well-structured?** Yes — conditional branching separates JSON and human paths with zero regression risk.
