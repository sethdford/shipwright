Perfect! Based on my comprehensive audit:

## Summary

The autonomous agent successfully completed the "shipwright doctor should validate dashboard dependencies and port availability" feature. Here's the assessment:

### ✅ **Meaningful Progress Achieved**
- **Feature fully implemented** with all 4 sub-checks as specified in the design:
  1. Bun runtime detection with version display and install instructions
  2. Dashboard server.ts location across 3 priority paths (dev → XDG → legacy)
  3. Public asset validation (index.html, app.js, styles.css)
  4. Port 8767 availability with lsof/ss/netstat fallback chain

### ✅ **No Bugs or Logic Errors**
- Bash 3.2 compatible (no associative arrays, readarray, or case conversion)
- Properly handles `set -euo pipefail` with guarded grep commands
- PID file handling correct (live vs stale detection)
- Port detection uses appropriate fallbacks for cross-platform support
- Follows codebase conventions (check_pass/warn/fail helpers, output formatting)

### ✅ **No Incomplete Work**
- Zero TODO/FIXME markers
- Clean single feature commit (cc1b955) with proper test coverage
- 14 dedicated tests all passing
- 185 total tests passing (npm test)
- Doctor executes cleanly and shows dashboard section in output

### ✅ **No Regressions**
- All other doctor sections still work correctly
- Pass/warn/fail counters correctly updated
- Summary statistics accurate (24 passed, 6 warnings)
- No syntax errors (verified via bash -n)

### ✅ **Code Quality Acceptable**
- Design specifications followed exactly
- All acceptance criteria met
- Proper error messages with actionable guidance
- Follows project conventions throughout
