Perfect. Now I have a clear picture. Let me document my findings:

## AUDIT REPORT

### Critical Findings

**MAJOR ISSUE: Agent Work Was Not Performed - Credit Balance Exhausted**

The autonomous agent was unable to complete the task due to insufficient API credit balance. This is evidenced by:

1. **Loop State Analysis**: The `/home/runner/work/shipwright/shipwright/.claude/loop-state.md` shows 20 iterations were executed, but each iteration log contains only: `"Credit balance is too low"`

2. **Iteration Logs**: All 20 iteration log files (iteration-1.log through iteration-20.log) and corresponding audit logs contain only the message "Credit balance is too low" - no actual work was performed.

3. **Test Logs**: While test logs appear complete (392 lines each), they are generated from previously passing tests, not new tests for dashboard validation work.

4. **Git Commits**: The commits from iterations 15-20 only record the logging of empty iteration results. No actual code changes were made to implement the required feature.

5. **Goal Status**: The goal was to **"shipwright doctor should validate dashboard dependencies and port availability"** - This was not implemented. The codebase has no dashboard validation logic, no port availability checks, and no dependency validation in the doctor script.

### What Should Have Been Done

The agent should have:
- Added dashboard dependency checks (Bun, Node.js modules)
- Added port availability validation (especially port 3000 for the dashboard)
- Added validation that dashboard server files exist and are properly configured
- Added checks for Node.js and npm versions required by the dashboard

### What Was Actually Done

- The agent made 20 iterations but was immediately blocked by insufficient API credits
- No source code changes were made
- Only logging artifacts were generated
- The work loop continued iterating and committing empty progress markers

---

**AUDIT_FAIL**

**Issues:**
1. **No implementation of dashboard validation** - The core goal was not addressed
2. **No port availability checks** - Missing the port validation component
3. **No dashboard dependency validation** - Missing checks for dashboard prerequisites
4. **Credit exhaustion** - Loop continued despite being unable to perform work
5. **Incomplete task** - All 20 iterations failed before any meaningful code was written
