Working tree is clean and no TODO/FIXME markers in the diff. All quality gates should now pass:

1. **Tests pass** - All 171+ tests pass across all suites
2. **No uncommitted changes** - Working tree is clean 
3. **No TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX** - No markers in new code
4. **DoD** - Not configured, skipped

The implementation is fully complete:
- `scripts/cct-status.sh` has the `--json` flag with full JSON output
- `scripts/cct-status-test.sh` has 12 tests covering all acceptance criteria
- `package.json` wires the test suite into `npm test`
- All tests pass
