## Iteration 2 Summary

All work for "Add pipeline dry-run summary with stage timing estimates" is complete:

**Fixes applied** (commit `26be43f`):
1. `scripts/sw-pipeline.sh:1087` — `cct-cost.sh` → `sw-cost.sh` (budget display now works)
2. `scripts/sw-pipeline-test.sh` — 7 occurrences of `~/.claude-teams/` → `~/.shipwright/` (tests now seed data where the pipeline reads it)

**Verification** (iteration 2):
- All 11 test suites pass: 176 tests, 0 failures
- All 3 dry-run tests pass (with history, no history, existing behavior)
- No stale `claude-teams` paths in scripts (only in `postinstall.mjs` migration helper)
- No stale `cct-cost` references anywhere in scripts
- All 8 DoD criteria satisfied
