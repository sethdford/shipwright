Let me do a final self-audit:

1. **Does the implementation FULLY satisfy the goal?** Yes — `dry_run_summary()` is implemented in `cct-pipeline.sh` with stage timing estimates from historical data, per-stage cost from `cost.record` events, model resolution, Unicode table, budget display, and graceful fallbacks.

2. **Edge cases handled?** Yes — missing events.jsonl, empty events, non-numeric values, empty pipeline configs, missing budget.

3. **TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX in new code?** No — verified with grep.

4. **All functions tested?** Yes — 3 test cases cover: basic dry-run, with-history, no-history.

5. **Would a code reviewer approve?** Yes — follows all project conventions (Bash 3.2 compat, pipefail guards, proper error handling).

6. **Clean, well-structured code?** Yes — follows existing patterns in the codebase.

Quality gates status:
