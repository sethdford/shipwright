Excellent! All tests pass. Based on my comprehensive audit, the implementation is complete, correct, and well-tested.

## AUDIT_PASS

### Summary of Findings

**Goal Achievement: ✓ COMPLETE**

The agent successfully implemented the "pipeline dry-run summary with stage timing estimates" feature. The implementation includes:

1. **Core Functionality**
   - `--dry-run` CLI flag that displays pipeline configuration and estimated timing/cost without executing stages
   - `dry_run_summary()` function (lines 972-1094 in cct-pipeline.sh) that queries historical events for timing estimates
   - Median-based duration and cost calculations from historical `stage.completed` and `cost.record` events
   - Per-stage model resolution following the correct hierarchy (CLI > stage config > template default > "opus")
   - Unicode box-drawing table with Stage, Est. Duration, Model, and Est. Cost columns
   - Total row with summed estimates
   - Budget remaining display (when configured)
   - Graceful fallback to "no data" / "—" when history is unavailable

2. **Code Quality: ✓ EXCELLENT**
   - Bash 3.2 compatible (no forbidden constructs)
   - All grep/jq calls properly guarded with `2>/dev/null` and `|| true`
   - Proper pipefail handling throughout
   - Duration values validated with regex
   - Cost arithmetic handled safely via awk
   - Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK markers
   - Follows all project conventions

3. **Testing: ✓ COMPREHENSIVE**
   - 3 new test functions covering: basic dry-run, with history, without history
   - All 184 existing tests still pass (11 test suites)
   - No regressions
   - Tests verify correct median calculations ($0.12, $1.45, $4.80 → $6.37)
   - Tests verify graceful handling of missing events.jsonl
   - Tests verify no artifacts or branches are created

4. **Design Compliance: ✓ COMPLETE**
   - Reads enabled stages from PIPELINE_CONFIG via jq
   - Computes median (appropriate for skewed distributions)
   - Handles all edge cases (empty events, malformed data, missing files)
   - Zero side effects (no events emitted, no artifacts created, no branches)
   - Data flows correctly from CLI through to display

**Risk Assessment: LOW** — No known issues, all potential edge cases are handled, and the implementation is thoroughly tested.
