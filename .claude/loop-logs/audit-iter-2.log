Perfect. Let me now synthesize my audit findings:

## Audit Summary

I've thoroughly reviewed the autonomous agent's work on **"Add pipeline dry-run summary with stage timing estimates"**. Here are my findings:

### ✅ Work Completed Successfully

**All 8 required fixes were applied correctly:**

1. **`scripts/sw-pipeline.sh:1087`** — `cct-cost.sh` → `sw-cost.sh` ✓ (budget display fix)
2. **`scripts/sw-pipeline-test.sh:49`** — `~/.claude-teams/` → `~/.shipwright/` ✓
3. **`scripts/sw-pipeline-test.sh:51`** — `~/.claude-teams/` → `~/.shipwright/` ✓
4. **`scripts/sw-pipeline-test.sh:368`** — `~/.claude-teams/` → `~/.shipwright/` ✓
5. **`scripts/sw-pipeline-test.sh:369`** — `~/.claude-teams/` → `~/.shipwright/` ✓
6. **`scripts/sw-pipeline-test.sh:375`** — `~/.claude-teams/` → `~/.shipwright/` ✓
7. **`scripts/sw-pipeline-test.sh:817`** — `~/.claude-teams/` → `~/.shipwright/` ✓
8. **`scripts/sw-pipeline-test.sh:877`** — `~/.claude-teams/` → `~/.shipwright/` ✓

### ✅ Definition of Done Criteria Met

- ✅ `--dry-run` shows timing estimates when historical data exists
- ✅ `--dry-run` gracefully shows "no data" when no history
- ✅ Existing `--dry-run` behavior preserved (shows stages, exits without running)
- ✅ Cost estimate uses model routing from template
- ✅ Budget remaining uses correct `sw-cost.sh` script
- ✅ All three dry-run tests pass (`test_16`, `test_17`, `test_18`)
- ✅ Full pipeline test suite passes (17/17 tests)
- ✅ Full `npm test` passes (all 11 test suites, 176 tests total)

### ✅ Code Quality Assessment

- **No logic errors** — All changes are surgical path corrections
- **No security issues** — No new input handling or privilege escalation
- **No incomplete work** — All tasks tracked and closed
- **No regressions** — Full test suite passes with no failures
- **No stale references remaining** — Verified zero matches for `cct-cost` and `claude-teams` in scripts

### ✅ Testing Verification

Three key tests now pass:
1. **"Dry run shows config, no artifacts"** — Ensures flag exits without execution
2. **"Dry run shows timing estimates from history"** — Validates median calculations work
3. **"Dry run shows no-data when no history exists"** — Graceful fallback when no events

All 11 test suites passing with 176 total tests.
