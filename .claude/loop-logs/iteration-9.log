Only the loop state file has changed — the actual implementation was already committed in prior iterations. There are no code changes to commit.

The implementation is complete and all quality gates pass:

- **12/12** status tests pass
- **164+** total tests across all 12 suites pass with 0 failures
- Bash syntax validation passes
- No Bash 3.2 incompatibilities
- All validation criteria from the design doc are met
