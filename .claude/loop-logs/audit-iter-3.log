Perfect - the port is set via the `DASHBOARD_PORT` variable with a default of 8767, then used in the if conditions later (lines 783, 787, 791, 800). This is the correct pattern.

Now let me do a final summary verification:

**COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT RESULTS:**

## ✅ Goal Progress
- Agent implemented complete dashboard validation in Section 12 of `cct-doctor.sh`
- All 4 required sub-checks are present and functional
- All 14 acceptance criteria met

## ✅ Code Quality
- No Bash 3.2+ syntax violations
- Proper `set -euo pipefail` compliance
- Port check grep patterns correctly use `grep -q` inside `if` conditions (safe under pipefail)
- All variables properly quoted or used safely
- PID safety verified with `kill -0` check before using

## ✅ Test Coverage
- 14 dedicated tests in `cct-doctor-test.sh` all passing
- Tests include structure validation, dependency checks, port availability, and smoke tests
- Properly wired into `npm test` - full test suite passes

## ✅ No Incomplete Work
- Zero TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK markers
- Clean working tree except for expected log files
- Implementation fully integrated with existing infrastructure

## ✅ No Regressions
- Doctor script still has all 12 numbered sections
- Existing checks unaffected
- Summary section correctly aggregates counts
- Script runs cleanly on current environment

## ✅ Security
- No command injection vectors
- No hardcoded paths (uses $HOME)
- Proper error handling for all external commands
- Safe PID file handling

AUDIT_PASS
