Perfect! All 184 tests pass. Let me review my audit findings:

## Audit Summary

I have conducted a thorough code review of the autonomous agent's implementation of "Add pipeline dry-run summary with stage timing estimates". Here are my findings:

### ✓ Functionality Assessment

1. **Goal Achievement**: The agent successfully implemented the complete dry-run summary feature with all required capabilities:
   - `--dry-run` flag parses correctly (line 248)
   - `dry_run_summary()` function exists and is properly called (lines 972-1094, gated at 4085-4088)
   - Shows formatted table with Stage, Est. Duration, Model, Est. Cost columns
   - Displays budget remaining when configured
   - No side effects (no artifacts, events, or branches created)

2. **Design Compliance**: The implementation follows the approved design document precisely:
   - ✓ Reads enabled stages from pipeline template via `jq`
   - ✓ Computes median (not mean) duration from `stage.completed` events
   - ✓ Computes median cost from `cost.record` events per stage
   - ✓ Resolves model per-stage: CLI > stage config > template default > "opus"
   - ✓ Renders Unicode box-drawing table with fixed column widths
   - ✓ Gracefully degrades to "no data" / "—" when no history exists
   - ✓ Shows budget remaining via `cct-cost.sh remaining-budget`
   - ✓ Zero side effects

3. **Code Quality**: 
   - ✓ All Bash 3.2 compatible (no associative arrays, no `readarray`, no lowercase/uppercase operators)
   - ✓ All `grep` calls properly guarded with `2>/dev/null` and `|| true` for pipefail safety
   - ✓ No TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK markers left in code
   - ✓ Proper variable initialization (DRY_RUN=false at line 103)
   - ✓ All jq calls wrapped with error handling (`2>/dev/null || true`)
   - ✓ Floating-point arithmetic uses `awk` for correct cost summation

4. **Testing**:
   - ✓ All 184 tests pass (11 test suites)
   - ✓ Three new dry-run tests added and passing:
     - `test_dry_run`: Basic dry-run functionality
     - `test_dry_run_summary_with_history`: Median calculations with seeded events (0.12, 1.45, 4.80, totaling 6.37)
     - `test_dry_run_summary_no_history`: Graceful fallback without history
   - ✓ Tests verify: correct medians, no artifacts created, proper table formatting

5. **Error Handling**:
   - ✓ Missing `events.jsonl` handled gracefully
   - ✓ Non-numeric duration values rejected with validation regex
   - ✓ Empty pipeline configs produce empty table (no crash)
   - ✓ All grep pipelines protected from `pipefail` failures

6. **Features Verified**:
   - ✓ Model resolution hierarchy works correctly (CLI > stage > default > opus)
   - ✓ Duration formatting (120s → "2m 0s", etc.)
   - ✓ Cost formatting with dollar signs and decimal precision
   - ✓ Total row calculation (sum of per-stage medians)
   - ✓ Budget display conditional logic (hidden when unlimited)

7. **Completeness**:
   - ✓ All files modified as planned (cct-pipeline.sh, cct-pipeline-test.sh)
   - ✓ No new dependencies introduced
   - ✓ No regressions in existing functionality
   - ✓ All changes committed (clean `git status`)

### Issues Found: NONE

The implementation is complete, correct, and production-ready. No bugs, security issues, incomplete work, or regressions detected.
