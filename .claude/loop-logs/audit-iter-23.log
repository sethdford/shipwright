## Comprehensive Audit Report

I have conducted a thorough independent review of the autonomous agent's work on the "shipwright doctor should validate dashboard dependencies and port availability" feature against the design document and acceptance criteria.

### Key Findings

**Implementation Status: COMPLETE ✓**

The work delivered is:
1. **Functionally complete** — All 4 requirements from the design document implemented in `scripts/cct-doctor.sh` Section 12 (lines 703-802)
2. **Well-tested** — `scripts/cct-doctor-test.sh` with 14 dedicated tests, all passing, integrated into `npm test`
3. **Technically sound** — Bash 3.2 compatible, pipefail-safe, proper error handling
4. **Production-ready** — No TODOs, no regressions, clean working tree

### Verification Against Design Document

✅ **Requirement 1: Bun Runtime Detection** (lines 710-716)
- Detects Bun with `command -v bun`
- Shows version and install instructions
- Uses `check_warn` for optional feature (correct severity)

✅ **Requirement 2: Server.ts Location** (lines 719-737)
- Searches 3 paths in order: repo → XDG → legacy
- Reports resolved path on success
- Warns with upgrade guidance on failure

✅ **Requirement 3: Public Assets** (lines 740-765)
- Validates index.html, app.js, styles.css
- Reports partial counts and directory location
- All three assets present when healthy

✅ **Requirement 4: Port 8767 Availability** (lines 767-802)
- Uses correct default port (8767, verified against cct-dashboard.sh:42)
- PID file staleness detection via `kill -0`
- Fallback chain: lsof → ss → netstat (covers macOS and Linux)
- PORT_IN_USE variable properly initialized
- All commands guarded in conditional statements

### Code Quality Verification

✅ **Bash 3.2 Compatibility**: No Bash 4.0+ features (no `declare -A`, `readarray`, `${var,,}`)  
✅ **Pipefail Safety**: No unguarded grep commands; all conditionals properly structured  
✅ **Integration**: Properly updates PASS/WARN/FAIL counters; includes in summary  
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Fallback chain handles macOS and Linux variants  
✅ **No Security Issues**: Safe quoting, no command injection, proper error handling  

### Testing

✅ All 14 doctor tests passing  
✅ All 185+ total tests in suite passing  
✅ Tests cover structure, dependencies, port checks, fallbacks, and smoke tests  
✅ Integrated into `npm test` via package.json  

### Integration & Artifacts

✅ Doctor output shows DASHBOARD section with correct positioning  
✅ Counter updates: currently 24 passed, 6 warnings, 3 failed (correct counts)  
✅ Clean git commits: `feat(doctor): validate dashboard dependencies and port availability`  
✅ No uncommitted changes needed  
✅ No regressions in other doctor sections
