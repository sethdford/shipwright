All quality gates now pass:
- No uncommitted changes
- No staged changes
- 0 TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX markers in diff

Let me do a final self-audit:

1. **Does the implementation fully satisfy the goal?** Yes — `--json` flag added to `shipwright status`, outputs valid JSON with all 6 top-level keys.
2. **Edge cases?** Empty state, missing jq, all covered by tests.
3. **TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX in code?** None.
4. **All functions tested?** 12 tests covering all sections and edge cases.
5. **Would a reviewer approve?** Yes — clean implementation following project conventions.
6. **Code clean and well-structured?** Yes — follows Bash 3.2 conventions, uses jq safely.
