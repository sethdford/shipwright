Everything is complete. The implementation fully satisfies the goal:

**Summary of what's implemented:**
- `dry_run_summary()` function in `scripts/cct-pipeline.sh` (lines 972-1094)
- Unicode box-drawing table showing Stage, Est. Duration, Model, Est. Cost per enabled stage
- Median duration from historical `stage.completed` events
- Median cost from `cost.record` events per stage
- Model resolution hierarchy: CLI flag > stage config > template default > "opus"
- Budget remaining display when configured
- Graceful fallback ("no data" / "—") when no history exists
- Zero side effects during dry-run (no artifacts, no branches, no events)
- Two comprehensive tests with properly escaped assertions
- All 184 tests pass

**This iteration's fix:** Corrected dollar sign escaping and cleanup masking bugs in the test that were silently passing with wrong assertion patterns.
