All 12 tests pass. The implementation is fully complete:

- `scripts/cct-status.sh` — `--json` flag with full JSON output covering teams, tasks, daemon, heartbeats, machines, and timestamp
- `scripts/cct-status-test.sh` — 12-test suite covering all acceptance criteria
- `package.json` — test suite wired into `npm test`

There's no remaining implementation work. The feature was already built and merged in previous iterations on this branch.
