All tasks complete. Let me do a final self-audit against the Definition of Done:

- **`--dry-run` shows timing estimates when historical data exists**: Test 16 passes with `~2m 0s`, `~5m 0s`, `~15m 0s` and costs `$0.12`, `$1.45`, `$4.80`, total `~$6.37`
- **`--dry-run` gracefully shows "no data" when no history**: Test 17 passes with "no data" and "—"
- **Existing `--dry-run` behavior preserved**: Test 15 passes (shows stages, exits without artifacts)
- **Cost estimate uses model routing from template**: Already implemented in `dry_run_summary()`
- **Budget remaining uses correct `sw-cost.sh` script**: Fixed from `cct-cost.sh`
- **All three dry-run tests pass**: Tests 15, 16, 17 all pass
- **Full pipeline test suite passes**: 17/17
- **Full `npm test` passes**: All 11 suites pass
- **No stale `claude-teams` in scripts** (except migration helper): Verified
- **No stale `cct-cost` in scripts**: Verified
