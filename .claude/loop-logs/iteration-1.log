Perfect! The goal has been fully achieved. The shipwright CLI now has a `hello` command that outputs "hello world". The implementation:

1. ✅ Added the `hello` command to the help text
2. ✅ Implemented the command case statement in the main router
3. ✅ Tested the command works correctly
4. ✅ All tests pass
5. ✅ Committed with a descriptive message

The command is now available as `shipwright hello` (and with aliases `sw hello` and `cct hello`).
