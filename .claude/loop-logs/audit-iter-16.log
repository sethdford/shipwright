Perfect. The audit is complete. Let me summarize my findings:

## Audit Results

### ✅ All Acceptance Criteria Met

1. **Bun Runtime Check** (lines 710-716)
   - ✓ Detects if `bun` is installed
   - ✓ Shows version via `bun --version`
   - ✓ Provides install instructions when missing
   - ✓ Uses `check_warn()` for non-failure severity (correct — dashboard is optional)

2. **Dashboard Server.ts Location** (lines 719-737)
   - ✓ Searches 3 paths in priority order:
     - `${DOCTOR_REPO_DIR}/dashboard/server.ts` (dev/repo)
     - `~/.local/share/shipwright/dashboard/server.ts` (XDG)
     - `~/.shipwright/dashboard/server.ts` (legacy)
   - ✓ First match wins, stored in variable
   - ✓ Warns if none found with upgrade guidance

3. **Public Asset Validation** (lines 740-765)
   - ✓ Checks `index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css` exist
   - ✓ Counts assets and reports total
   - ✓ Warns if any missing

4. **Port 8767 Availability** (lines 767-802)
   - ✓ Checks PID file first, validates process alive via `kill -0`
   - ✓ Warns on stale PID file
   - ✓ Uses fallback chain: `lsof` → `ss` → `netstat`
   - ✓ Captures result into variable before testing (avoids `pipefail` issues)
   - ✓ Redirects grep stderr to avoid spurious output
   - ✓ Uses correct default port 8767 (not 3000)

5. **Pipeline Safety**
   - ✓ All scripts use `set -euo pipefail`
   - ✓ Port check grep guarded in `if` conditions (safe pattern)
   - ✓ All external commands have error handling
   - ✓ No unquoted variables in dangerous contexts
   - ✓ Bash 3.2 compatible (no associative arrays, no `readarray`)

6. **Test Coverage**
   - ✓ 14 tests in `scripts/cct-doctor-test.sh`
   - ✓ All tests pass (`npm test` shows 14/14 passing)
   - ✓ Tests cover: script structure, Bun check, server.ts location, asset validation, port checks, fallback chain, multiple install paths, smoke tests
   - ✓ Wired into `npm test` via `package.json`

7. **Code Quality**
   - ✓ Follows existing patterns (check_pass/warn/fail helpers)
   - ✓ Consistent styling and indentation
   - ✓ Clear variable names and comments
   - ✓ Unicode box-drawing headers match theme
   - ✓ Proper use of color constants (CYAN, PURPLE, etc.)
   - ✓ Summary section correctly picks up pass/warn/fail counts

### ✅ No Issues Found

- No incomplete work (no TODO markers)
- No placeholder code
- No logic errors
- No security vulnerabilities
- No regressions (185 total tests passing)
- Git working tree clean (only log files modified)
- Matches design document exactly
- Feature is already complete and working

**AUDIT_PASS**
