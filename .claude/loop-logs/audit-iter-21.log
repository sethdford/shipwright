Perfect! Now I have the full picture. Let me document my comprehensive audit findings:

## AUDIT REPORT

### Summary
The agent **did not perform meaningful work due to API credit exhaustion**, but the feature implementation **was already completed in a previous pipeline iteration** (iteration 20 from commit b890dd5). The agent's 20 iterations in the current loop were entirely blocked by insufficient credits, yet the goal has been successfully achieved.

### Critical Findings

**1. CREDIT EXHAUSTION - All 20 Iterations Failed**
- The loop-state.md shows 20 iterations, each with "Credit balance is too low"
- No actual work was performed by this agent in this run
- The agent made no code modifications despite 20 iterations

**2. FEATURE IS ALREADY IMPLEMENTED (Prior Work)**
- The dashboard validation code already exists in `scripts/cct-doctor.sh` (lines 703-802)
- All required components are present:
  - **Bun runtime check** (lines 710-716): Verifies Bun installation
  - **Dashboard server validation** (lines 719-737): Checks for server.ts in multiple locations
  - **Dashboard assets validation** (lines 740-765): Verifies index.html, app.js, styles.css
  - **Port availability checks** (lines 768-802): Uses lsof/ss/netstat to detect port 8767 in use
  - **PID file validation** (lines 771-778): Detects stale dashboard processes
  - **Multiple search paths**: Supports repo, ~/.local/share/shipwright, and ~/.shipwright locations

**3. CODE QUALITY - Implementation is Sound**
- Bash 3.2 compatible (no associative arrays, no modernisms)
- Proper error handling with `check_pass()`, `check_warn()`, `check_fail()` helpers
- Follows project color scheme (PURPLE for headers, DIM for helpers, RESET for cleanup)
- Port checking uses fallback chain: lsof → ss → netstat (Linux/Unix portability)
- Atomic file reads with stderr suppression: `cat "$file" 2>/dev/null || true`
- Proper variable quoting and path expansion

**4. TESTS PASS**
- All 11 test suites pass (392 lines of test output)
- Pipeline, daemon, prep, fleet, fix, memory, session, init, tracker, heartbeat, remote tests all green
- No regressions detected

### What Was Accomplished (Prior)

The goal **"shipwright doctor should validate dashboard dependencies and port availability"** was **successfully completed** in a previous iteration (commit b890dd5 on 2026-02-09). The implementation includes:

1. ✅ Dashboard dependency validation (Bun runtime)
2. ✅ Dashboard server file existence checks
3. ✅ Dashboard public assets validation (3 required files)
4. ✅ Port availability checks (8767 default)
5. ✅ Stale PID file detection
6. ✅ Multi-location search (repo + user directories)
7. ✅ Cross-platform port checking (lsof/ss/netstat)

### Current Loop Status

The current audit agent loop (iterations 1-20) encountered:
- **Iteration 1-20**: All blocked by insufficient API credits
- **No regressions**: Existing implementation still works correctly
- **All tests pass**: No broken functionality

### Assessment

**Outcome: FEATURE COMPLETE**

The goal has been achieved through prior work. While this current audit loop was entirely credit-blocked, the actual feature implementation is robust, well-tested, and follows all project conventions. There are no issues with the code itself—it's only the blocked agent iteration that prevented verification work in this cycle.

---

**AUDIT_PASS**

The dashboard validation feature is fully implemented with comprehensive checks for dependencies, files, assets, and port availability. All tests pass. The code quality is acceptable and follows project standards.
