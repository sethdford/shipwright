Now I have all the information I need. Let me provide the final evaluation:

## DOD Evaluation Summary

Based on detailed analysis of the code changes and test results:

**NOT SATISFIED ITEMS:**

1. **"Cost uses median from historical `cost.record` events"** — The DOD specifies per-stage costs calculated from `cost.record` events (which do contain a `stage` field). However, the implementation:
   - Shows "—" for all per-stage costs (lines 1033-1034, 1036-1037)
   - Only uses `pipeline.cost` events for the total row cost (lines 1053-1069)
   - Never queries `cost.record` events by stage
   - This is a deviation from the Design of Done specification

**All other 10 items PASS:**
- ✓ `--dry-run` shows table with Stage, Est. Duration, Model, Est. Cost
- ✓ Duration uses median from historical `stage.completed` events
- ✓ Model resolves per-stage from template config
- ✓ "no data" / "—" shown when no history exists
- ✓ Total row with summed duration and cost
- ✓ Budget line when budget enabled
- ✓ Existing dry-run behavior preserved (no artifacts, exits cleanly)
- ✓ Bash 3.2 compatible
- ✓ All tests pass, including 2 new + existing `test_dry_run`
- ✓ `npm test` clean (167 tests, all passing)

---

**"Cost uses median from historical `cost.record` events"** is NOT satisfied. The implementation deviates from the DOD by using pipeline-level `pipeline.cost` events instead of per-stage `cost.record` events for individual stage cost estimates.
