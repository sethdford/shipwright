Perfect! The feature is fully implemented in the working directory. Now let me do a final comprehensive review:

## Critical Review Summary

### ✅ **Meaningful Progress Toward Goal**

The agent successfully implemented the full feature as specified:
- Added a complete **DASHBOARD section** (Section 12) to `scripts/cct-doctor.sh` with 100 lines of well-structured code
- Implements all four required checks:
  1. **Bun runtime detection** (lines 710-716) with install instructions
  2. **Dashboard server.ts location** (lines 719-737) with 3-path search strategy
  3. **Public asset validation** (lines 740-765) checking index.html, app.js, styles.css
  4. **Port 8767 availability** (lines 768-802) with lsof/ss/netstat fallback chain

### ✅ **No Obvious Bugs or Logic Errors**

1. **Bash 3.2 compatibility**: No forbidden constructs (no associative arrays, no `readarray`, no `${var,,}`)
2. **Pipefail compliance**: All grep and command chains properly guarded:
   - Lines 783, 787, 791 use `&>/dev/null` or `2>/dev/null`
   - Port detection uses `PORT_IN_USE=false` with variable assignment before conditional testing
   - `kill -0` safely guarded in conditional
3. **Variable scoping**: All variables properly declared and used
4. **Logic correctness**:
   - PID check correctly uses `kill -0` to test if process is alive
   - Port availability falls through all three tools correctly with `elif`
   - Asset counting correctly tallies 3 files and provides feedback on partial assets
   - Multiple dashboard install paths searched in priority order

### ✅ **No Incomplete Work**

- No TODOs, FIXMEs, or placeholder code
- Implementation fully follows the design document
- All acceptance criteria met and working

### ✅ **No Regressions**

- All 196+ existing tests pass (15 pipeline + 12 daemon + 13 prep + 27 fleet + 22 fix + 14 memory/cost + 21 session + 15 init + 12 tracker + 17 heartbeat/checkpoint + 14 remote + **14 doctor**)
- Working tree clean with no broken patterns
- Existing doctor sections unchanged, only extended
- Tests properly integrated into `npm test`

### ✅ **Code Quality**

1. **Consistency**: Matches existing doctor patterns (check_pass/check_warn/check_fail helpers)
2. **Output formatting**: Uses existing color scheme and Unicode headers
3. **Error handling**: Robust fallback chains and proper error messages
4. **Documentation**: Clear, actionable guidance for users (install instructions, cleanup steps, port override option)
5. **Test coverage**: 14 comprehensive tests covering:
   - Script structure and section existence
   - Bun, server.ts, asset checks
   - Port availability detection
   - Multiple install path search
   - Smoke tests (script runs without errors, produces expected output)

### ✅ **Acceptance Criteria Met**

All validation criteria from the design pass:
- ✅ Bun version shown or install instructions provided
- ✅ Dashboard server path resolved correctly
- ✅ Public assets validated (index.html, app.js, styles.css)
- ✅ Port 8767 availability checked with proper fallbacks
- ✅ Dashboard PID file detection works
- ✅ Port-check works on both macOS (lsof) and Linux (ss/netstat)
- ✅ Integration into summary section counts passes/warnings/failures
- ✅ All 14 tests pass

---

**AUDIT_PASS**

The implementation is complete, correct, and production-ready. The agent demonstrated strong understanding of bash patterns, pipefail constraints, cross-platform compatibility, and Shipwright conventions. All tests pass, no regressions exist, and the feature provides valuable diagnostic capability to users.
