Good, no Bash 4+ specific features in that section. Now let me summarize my findings:

## AUDIT FINDINGS

**Critical Issue:**

1. **Per-Stage Cost Implementation Missing**: The design specification explicitly requires implementing per-stage cost estimates from `cost.record` events. The implementation always displays "—" for per-stage costs (line 1034-1035) and only computes a pipeline-level cost total. 

   - Design line 26: "**Median cost** from `$EVENTS_FILE` — grep for `cost.record` events matching the stage id"
   - Validation criteria line 230: "With seeded `cost.record` events, cost column shows median cost formatted as `$X.XX`"
   - Task 5 in the checklist explicitly states: "Implement median cost from `events.jsonl` `cost.record` events"
   - The agent adapted the design without explicitly documenting or acknowledging this deviation (only mentioned in task checklist line 9 as an afterthought)
   - The tests don't validate per-stage costs because they never seed `cost.record` events

**Non-Critical Issues:**

2. **Model Resolution Order**: The implementation applies CLI `$MODEL` override *after* reading from config (lines 1010-1011). The design specifies: "CLI `$MODEL` > stage `.config.model` > `.defaults.model` > `"opus"`". The order is correct but the implementation reads config first, then overrides with CLI. This works correctly but is slightly backwards from the logical flow.

3. **Event Data for Total Cost**: The implementation uses `pipeline.cost` events for the pipeline total cost, which works and provides a summary. However, this could alternatively be derived from summing per-stage costs, which would be more consistent if per-stage costs were implemented.

4. **Test Validation Incomplete**: The new tests (`test_dry_run_summary_with_history` and `test_dry_run_summary_no_history`) don't validate per-stage costs, so they pass despite the incomplete implementation.

5. **Documentation Gap**: The comment on line 1033 states "(pipeline-level, not per-stage)" but doesn't explain *why* this choice was made, giving the false impression this was intentional rather than an incomplete implementation.

**What Works Well:**

- Table formatting with Unicode box-drawing characters ✓
- Median duration calculation from historical `stage.completed` events ✓
- Model resolution (4-tier cascade) ✓
- Graceful fallback to "no data" when no history exists ✓
- Budget remaining display integration ✓
- Test backup/restore of events.jsonl ✓
- All 17 pipeline tests pass (though tests don't validate the missing feature)
- Bash 3.2 compatibility maintained ✓
- Integration with `format_duration()` helper ✓
- Proper `set -euo pipefail` compliance with `|| true` guards ✓

AUDIT_FAIL - Per-stage cost estimation feature from the design specification was not implemented, only pipeline-level costs. This is a material deviation from the requirements that should be corrected.
