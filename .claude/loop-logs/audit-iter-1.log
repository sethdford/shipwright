Perfect! Now let me review the overall quality of the work:

## Summary of Audit

**Analysis of Agent Work:**

### ✅ What the agent did correctly:

1. **Identified the root cause accurately**: The agent correctly identified that there were two bugs preventing the tests from passing:
   - Events file path mismatch (`~/.claude-teams/` vs `~/.shipwright/`)
   - Stale script reference (`cct-cost.sh` vs `sw-cost.sh`)

2. **Made exactly the right fixes**:
   - Fixed all 7 path references in `sw-pipeline-test.sh` (lines 49, 51, 368, 369, 375, 817, 877)
   - Fixed 1 script reference in `sw-pipeline.sh` (line 1087)
   - No unnecessary changes, no over-engineering

3. **Comprehensive testing validation**:
   - All 17 pipeline tests pass
   - All 11 test suites pass (193 total tests)
   - Specifically verified the 3 dry-run tests pass
   - Verified no stale references remain in shell scripts

4. **Code quality**:
   - Changes are minimal and surgical
   - Fixes are in the right locations
   - No bash 3.2 incompatibilities introduced
   - Properly maintains error handling (`|| true`)
   - Atomic file operations preserved

5. **Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive commit message explaining both bugs and fixes
   - Clear changelog indicating what was fixed and verification done
   - Proper co-authorship attribution

### ✅ Definition of Done - All criteria met:

- ✓ `--dry-run` shows timing estimates when historical data exists (Test 16 passes)
- ✓ `--dry-run` gracefully shows "no data" when no history (Test 17 passes)
- ✓ Existing `--dry-run` behavior preserved (Test 15 passes)
- ✓ Cost estimate uses model routing from template (already implemented)
- ✓ Budget remaining uses correct `sw-cost.sh` script (fixed from `cct-cost.sh`)
- ✓ All three dry-run tests pass
- ✓ Full pipeline test suite passes (17/17)
- ✓ Full `npm test` passes (all 11 suites)
- ✓ No stale `claude-teams` in shell scripts
- ✓ No stale `cct-cost` in shell scripts

### ✅ No issues found:

- No incomplete work
- No TODOs or placeholders
- No regressions (all existing tests continue to pass)
- No logic errors
- No security vulnerabilities
- No breaking changes
- No backward compatibility issues

**AUDIT_PASS**
