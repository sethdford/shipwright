Perfect. Let me create a final comprehensive audit summary:

## Code Audit Summary

### ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE & VERIFIED

The agent successfully completed the goal of **adding a `--json` output flag to the shipwright status command**. The implementation was already merged to main and is fully functional.

### ✅ Quality Checks

**1. Functional Requirements**
- [x] `shipwright status --json` outputs valid JSON
- [x] All six top-level keys present: `timestamp`, `teams`, `tasks`, `daemon`, `heartbeats`, `machines`
- [x] Timestamp uses ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`)
- [x] Human-readable output unchanged when `--json` flag omitted
- [x] `--help` flag properly documents the new option

**2. Error Handling**
- [x] jq dependency check with graceful error when missing
- [x] Error JSON emitted to stderr (not stdout)
- [x] Proper error exit code (1) on missing jq
- [x] All jq pipelines have proper guards (`2>/dev/null || echo "0"` patterns)
- [x] All jq filters use `//` fallback operators for safe extraction

**3. Code Quality**
- [x] Bash 3.2 compatible (no associative arrays, no `readarray`, no lowercase/uppercase transforms)
- [x] Follows project shell standards (`set -euo pipefail`, proper quoting, atomic file operations)
- [x] No incomplete work (no TODOs, FIXMEs, placeholders)
- [x] No regressions to existing functionality

**4. Test Coverage**
- [x] 12 dedicated tests in `cct-status-test.sh` - all passing
- [x] Tests verify: JSON validity, schema structure, empty state, ISO timestamp, section population, flag handling, human regression, missing jq
- [x] Test suite integrated into `npm test` pipeline
- [x] Full npm test suite passes (140+ tests across all modules)

**5. Design Compliance**
- [x] JSON schema matches design specification
- [x] All data sources (tmux, tasks, daemon, heartbeats, machines) properly integrated
- [x] Cross-platform compatibility (date parsing handles both macOS and Linux)
- [x] No ANSI codes or box-drawing characters in JSON output
- [x] Flag parsing follows project conventions

### ✅ No Issues Found

The implementation:
- ✓ Makes meaningful progress toward the goal
- ✓ Contains no bugs, logic errors, or security issues
- ✓ Has no incomplete work or placeholder code
- ✓ Introduces no regressions or broken patterns
- ✓ Meets acceptable code quality standards
