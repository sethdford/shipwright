All quality gates pass:

1. **Tests**: All 184 tests pass across 11 test suites (17+12+13+27+22+14+21+15+12+17+14)
2. **No uncommitted changes**: Working tree clean
3. **Implementation complete**: `dry_run_summary()` function in `cct-pipeline.sh` with three comprehensive test cases
4. **Audit**: AUDIT_PASS from iteration 4 audit agent

The feature is fully implemented:
- `--dry-run` flag shows a formatted table with Stage, Est. Duration, Model, Est. Cost columns
- Duration uses median from historical `stage.completed` events
- Cost uses pipeline-level median from `pipeline.cost` events
- Model resolution per-stage from template config (CLI > stage config > defaults > opus)
- "no data" / "—" graceful fallback when no history exists
- Total row with summed duration and cost
- Budget remaining display when configured
