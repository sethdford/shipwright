Working tree is clean. Let me verify all the quality gate conditions:

1. **Tests pass** - All 121 tests pass including 12 status tests
2. **No uncommitted changes** - Working tree is clean
3. **No TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX in new code** - None present
4. **Audit passed** - AUDIT_PASS from iteration 4

The implementation is complete:
- `scripts/cct-status.sh` — `--json` flag with full JSON output for all sections (teams, tasks, daemon, heartbeats, machines, timestamp)
- `scripts/cct-status-test.sh` — 12-test suite covering all acceptance criteria
- `package.json` — test suite wired into `npm test`
