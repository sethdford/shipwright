:::caution[Terminal Compatibility]
Split-pane agent teams require a real terminal emulator. **VS Code's integrated terminal and Ghostty are not supported.** Use iTerm2, Alacritty, Kitty, or WezTerm. See [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/) for details.

## Installation

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Full Install (Recommended)">
    Interactive installer that sets up tmux config, Claude Code settings, hooks, and the `shipwright` CLI:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sethdford/shipwright.git
    cd shipwright
    ./install.sh
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Quick Setup (tmux only)">
    One-command setup with no prompts — installs just the tmux configuration:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sethdford/shipwright.git
    cd shipwright
    ./scripts/sw-init.sh
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Your First Team Session

<Steps>

1. **Start tmux**

   ```bash
   tmux new -s dev
   ```

2. **Launch a team session with a template**

   ```bash
   shipwright session my-feature --template feature-dev
   ```

   This creates a 3-agent team (backend, frontend, tests) with the leader pane taking 65% of the screen.

3. **Start coding with Claude**

   ```bash
   claude
   ```

   Tell Claude what you want to build. It will coordinate the agents across tmux panes.

4. **Monitor your team**

   ```bash
   shipwright status      # Team dashboard
   shipwright ps          # Running agent processes
   ```

   Or press `Ctrl-a` then `Ctrl-t` for an inline dashboard.

</Steps>

## Verify Your Setup

Run the built-in doctor to check everything is configured correctly:

```bash
shipwright doctor
```

This checks tmux version, jq availability, overlay hooks, color configuration, and orphaned sessions.
