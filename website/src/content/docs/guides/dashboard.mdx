description: Real-time web dashboard for monitoring pipelines, agents, and daemon status.
---

The Shipwright dashboard provides a real-time web interface for monitoring pipeline progress, agent activity, daemon status, and DORA metrics. It uses WebSocket connections for live updates.

## Prerequisites

The dashboard requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## Starting the Dashboard

```bash
# Foreground (see logs in terminal)
shipwright dashboard

# Background (runs in detached mode)
shipwright dashboard start

# Stop background dashboard
shipwright dashboard stop
```

The dashboard runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Features

### Pipeline Monitoring

View real-time progress for all active pipelines:

- Current stage and elapsed time per stage
- Self-healing cycle status
- Build agent output
- Test results and coverage
- Review findings

### Agent Activity

Track all running Claude Code agents:

- Heartbeat status (alive, stale, dead)
- Current task and iteration count
- Token usage per agent
- Session mapping (which tmux pane)

### Daemon Status

Monitor the autonomous daemon:

- Active jobs and queue depth
- Worker utilization and auto-scaling decisions
- Issue triage scores
- Recent completions and failures

### DORA Metrics

Live DORA/DX metrics dashboard:

- **Lead Time** — time from issue creation to PR merge
- **Deployment Frequency** — pipelines completed per day
- **Change Failure Rate** — percentage of pipelines that fail
- **Mean Time to Recovery** — time from failure to successful retry

### Predictions

When the intelligence layer is enabled, the dashboard displays prediction data for active pipelines:

- Predicted completion time
- Success probability
- Estimated cost
- Risk factors for each stage

This data comes from the predictive analytics module. See the [Intelligence guide](/guides/intelligence/) for configuration.

## Architecture

The dashboard consists of:

| Component      | Location                     | Purpose                                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server**     | `dashboard/server.ts`        | Bun WebSocket server, reads pipeline state and events |
| **Frontend**   | `dashboard/public/`          | HTML/CSS/JS single-page application                   |
| **Events**     | `~/.shipwright/events.jsonl` | JSONL event stream consumed by the server             |
| **State**      | `.claude/pipeline-state.md`  | Pipeline state file polled for updates                |
| **Heartbeats** | `~/.shipwright/heartbeats/`  | Agent liveness data                                   |

The server watches the events file and pipeline state for changes, pushing updates to connected clients via WebSocket.

## Configuration

The dashboard reads from standard Shipwright configuration locations. No additional configuration is required beyond having a running pipeline or daemon.

To change the port:

```bash
PORT=8080 shipwright dashboard
```
