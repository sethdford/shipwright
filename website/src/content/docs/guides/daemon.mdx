title: Autonomous Daemon
description: Run Shipwright as a background daemon that watches GitHub issues and automatically spawns delivery pipelines.
---

The daemon (`cct daemon`) runs in the background, polling GitHub for new issues and automatically spawning delivery pipelines to handle them. Combined with DORA metrics, it gives you a fully autonomous development operation.

## How It Works

1. The daemon polls your GitHub repo for issues with a configurable label (default: `shipwright`)
2. When a matching issue is found, it spawns a new pipeline (`cct pipeline start --issue <id>`)
3. The pipeline runs autonomously through the configured stages
4. When the pipeline completes, the daemon reaps the finished process
5. Metrics are emitted at every step for DORA tracking

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize daemon configuration
cct daemon init

# Start the daemon
cct daemon start

# Check daemon status
cct daemon status

# View daemon logs
cct daemon logs --follow

# Stop the daemon
cct daemon stop
```

## DORA Metrics

The daemon tracks delivery performance using the four DORA metrics:

| Metric | What It Measures | Elite | High | Medium | Low |
|--------|-----------------|-------|------|--------|-----|
| **Deployment Frequency** | How often you deploy | On-demand | Daily–Weekly | Weekly–Monthly | Monthly+ |
| **Cycle Time** | Time from commit to deploy | < 1 hour | < 1 day | < 1 week | 1 week+ |
| **Change Failure Rate** | % of deploys causing failure | < 5% | < 10% | < 15% | 15%+ |
| **Mean Time to Restore** | Recovery time after failure | < 1 hour | < 1 day | < 1 week | 1 week+ |

View your metrics dashboard:

```bash
# Default: last 7 days
cct daemon metrics

# Custom period
cct daemon metrics --period 30

# JSON output for tooling
cct daemon metrics --json
```

Grades follow Google's DORA research thresholds: **Elite**, **High**, **Medium**, **Low**.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cct daemon init` | Create daemon configuration file |
| `cct daemon start` | Start the background daemon |
| `cct daemon stop` | Stop the daemon gracefully |
| `cct daemon status` | Show daemon status and current pipelines |
| `cct daemon metrics` | Display DORA metrics dashboard |
| `cct daemon logs` | View daemon log output |

## Event Logging

All daemon and pipeline events are logged to `~/.claude-teams/events.jsonl` as newline-delimited JSON. Events include:

- `daemon.started`, `daemon.stopped`
- `daemon.poll` — each polling cycle
- `daemon.spawn` — new pipeline started
- `daemon.reap` — pipeline process finished
- `pipeline.started`, `pipeline.completed`
- `stage.started`, `stage.completed`, `stage.failed`

These events power the DORA metrics dashboard and can be consumed by external tools.

## Configuration

After running `cct daemon init`, edit the configuration file at `~/.claude-teams/daemon.json`:

```json
{
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "label": "shipwright",
  "poll_interval": 60,
  "pipeline": "standard",
  "max_concurrent": 2,
  "auto_assign": true
}
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `repo` | auto-detected | GitHub repository (owner/repo) |
| `label` | `"shipwright"` | Issue label to watch for |
| `poll_interval` | `60` | Seconds between polls |
| `pipeline` | `"standard"` | Default pipeline template |
| `max_concurrent` | `2` | Maximum concurrent pipelines |
| `auto_assign` | `true` | Self-assign issues when starting |
