description: Bidirectional integration with Linear and Jira for pipeline-driven issue management.
---

Shipwright integrates with issue trackers to provide bidirectional sync between pipelines and your project management tool. When a pipeline completes a stage, the tracker is updated automatically. When issues are created or updated in the tracker, they can trigger pipeline runs.

## Supported Trackers

| Tracker           | Status       | Features                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Linear**        | Full support | Bidirectional sync, status updates, stage comments     |
| **Jira**          | Full support | Bidirectional sync, status transitions, stage comments |
| **GitHub Issues** | Built-in     | Always available, no configuration needed              |

## Architecture

Shipwright uses a **router pattern** for tracker integration:

```
Pipeline → cct-tracker.sh (router) → cct-tracker-linear.sh
                                   → cct-tracker-jira.sh
```

The router reads `~/.claude-teams/tracker-config.json` to determine which provider to use, then delegates to the provider-specific script.

## Configuration

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Configure Linear
shipwright linear setup

# Configure Jira
shipwright jira setup
```

### Configuration File

The tracker configuration lives at `~/.claude-teams/tracker-config.json`:

```json
{
  "provider": "linear",
  "linear": {
    "api_key": "lin_api_...",
    "team_id": "TEAM-ID",
    "project_id": "PROJECT-ID"
  }
}
```

For Jira:

```json
{
  "provider": "jira",
  "jira": {
    "url": "https://yourcompany.atlassian.net",
    "email": "you@company.com",
    "api_token": "...",
    "project_key": "PROJ"
  }
}
```

## Pipeline Integration

The pipeline automatically notifies the tracker at key points:

| Event                 | When                      | What Gets Updated            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Stage complete**    | After each stage finishes | Stage name, duration, status |
| **Stage failed**      | When a stage fails        | Error context, failed stage  |
| **PR created**        | After PR stage            | PR URL linked to issue       |
| **Pipeline complete** | On successful completion  | Issue status moved to "Done" |
| **Pipeline failed**   | On final failure          | Issue gets failure summary   |

## Daemon Integration

The daemon also integrates with the tracker:

| Event             | Description                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Job spawned**   | Issue marked as "In Progress"       |
| **Job completed** | Issue marked as "Done" with PR link |
| **Job failed**    | Issue updated with failure details  |

## Commands

```bash
# Check current tracker configuration
shipwright tracker config

# Manual sync (usually automatic)
shipwright tracker notify stage_complete <issue> "<stage>|<duration>|<description>"

# Linear-specific commands
shipwright linear setup          # Configure Linear
shipwright linear sync <issue>   # Manual sync

# Jira-specific commands
shipwright jira setup            # Configure Jira
shipwright jira sync <issue>     # Manual sync
```

## Disabling Tracker Integration

If you only want GitHub Issues (the default), simply don't configure a tracker. The pipeline always posts progress comments to GitHub Issues regardless of tracker configuration.

To temporarily disable tracker notifications:

```bash
NO_TRACKER=true shipwright pipeline start --issue 42
```
