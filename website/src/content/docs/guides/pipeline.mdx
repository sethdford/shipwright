title: Delivery Pipeline
description: Chain the full SDLC into a single command — from issue intake to PR creation with self-healing builds and GitHub integration.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The delivery pipeline (`cct pipeline`) automates the entire software development lifecycle. Start from a GitHub issue or a goal description and Shipwright handles planning, building, testing, reviewing, and PR creation.

## Pipeline Stages

```
intake → plan → build → test → review → compound_quality → pr → deploy → validate
```

Each stage can be enabled/disabled and gated (auto-proceed or pause for approval).

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **intake** | Fetch issue metadata from GitHub, or parse the goal description |
| **plan** | Claude generates an implementation plan |
| **build** | Delegates to `cct loop` for autonomous multi-iteration development |
| **test** | Run the test suite and collect results |
| **review** | Claude reviews the changes for quality and correctness |
| **compound_quality** | Self-healing cycle — if tests fail, re-enter build with error context |
| **pr** | Create a GitHub PR with labels, milestone, and reviewers |
| **deploy** | Deploy to staging/production (if configured) |
| **validate** | Post-deploy validation checks |

## Quick Start

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="From a GitHub Issue">
    ```bash
    # Fully autonomous — fetches issue, plans, builds, creates PR
    cct pipeline start --issue 123 --skip-gates
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="From a Goal">
    ```bash
    cct pipeline start --goal "Add JWT authentication"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Hotfix">
    ```bash
    cct pipeline start --issue 456 --pipeline hotfix --test-cmd "pytest"
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Pipeline Templates

| Template | Stages | Gates | Use Case |
|----------|--------|-------|----------|
| `standard` | intake → plan → build → test → review → PR | approve: plan, review, pr | Normal feature work |
| `fast` | intake → build → test → PR | all auto | Quick fixes |
| `full` | all 8 stages | approve: plan, review, pr, deploy | Production deployment |
| `hotfix` | intake → build → test → PR | all auto | Urgent production fixes |
| `autonomous` | all stages | all auto | Fully autonomous operation |

Browse templates:

```bash
cct pipeline list        # List all templates
cct pipeline show standard  # View template details
```

## Self-Healing Builds

When tests fail after a build, the pipeline automatically captures the error output and re-enters the build loop with that context — just like a human developer reading test failures and fixing them.

```bash
# Allow up to 3 self-healing cycles
cct pipeline start --goal "Build payment flow" --self-heal 3
```

The compound quality stage orchestrates this: it runs tests, and if they fail, feeds the failure output back to the build agent as context for the next iteration.

## GitHub Integration

The pipeline deeply integrates with GitHub when starting from an issue:

- **Auto-fetches** issue title, body, labels, and milestone
- **Self-assigns** the issue to signal work has started
- **Posts progress comments** as stages complete
- **Creates PRs** with labels, milestone, and reviewers propagated from the issue
- **Closes the issue** when the PR is ready

## Auto-Detection

Shipwright automatically detects your project configuration:

- **Test command** — supports 9+ project types (npm, pytest, go test, cargo test, etc.)
- **Branch prefix** — derived from task type (feature/, fix/, hotfix/)
- **Reviewers** — from CODEOWNERS or git history
- **Language and framework** — for context-aware planning

## Managing Pipelines

```bash
# Resume a pipeline from where it left off
cct pipeline resume

# Check pipeline progress
cct pipeline status

# Abort a running pipeline
cct pipeline abort
```

## Notifications

Get notified about pipeline events via webhooks:

```bash
# Slack webhook
cct pipeline start --goal "Add auth" --slack-webhook https://hooks.slack.com/...

# Custom webhook (via environment variable)
export CCT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook.example.com
cct pipeline start --goal "Add auth"
```

## Pipeline State

Pipeline progress is tracked in `.claude/pipeline-state.md` and artifacts are stored in `.claude/pipeline-artifacts/`. This allows pipelines to be resumed after interruption.
