title: Delivery Pipeline
description: Chain the full SDLC into a single command — from issue intake to PR creation with self-healing builds and GitHub integration.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The delivery pipeline (`shipwright pipeline`) automates the entire software development lifecycle. Start from a GitHub issue or a goal description and Shipwright handles planning, building, testing, reviewing, and PR creation.

## Pipeline Stages

```
intake → plan → design → build → test → review → compound_quality → pr → merge → deploy → validate → monitor
```

12 stages, each can be enabled/disabled and gated (auto-proceed or pause for approval).

| Stage                | What Happens                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **intake**           | Fetch issue metadata from GitHub, or parse the goal description           |
| **plan**             | Claude generates an implementation plan with tasks and approach           |
| **design**           | Design interfaces, data models, and API contracts                         |
| **build**            | Delegates to `shipwright loop` for autonomous multi-iteration development |
| **test**             | Run the test suite and validate coverage                                  |
| **review**           | Claude reviews the changes for quality, security, and correctness         |
| **compound_quality** | Multi-dimensional quality audit — adversarial, negative, e2e, DoD         |
| **pr**               | Create a GitHub PR with labels, milestone, and reviewers                  |
| **merge**            | Auto-merge with CI wait and squash (deployed/enterprise templates)        |
| **deploy**           | Deploy to staging/production (if configured)                              |
| **validate**         | Post-deploy smoke tests and health URL checks                             |
| **monitor**          | Watch for errors post-deploy with auto-rollback                           |

## Quick Start

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="From a GitHub Issue">
    ```bash
    # Fully autonomous — fetches issue, plans, builds, creates PR
    shipwright pipeline start --issue 123 --skip-gates
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="From a Goal">
    ```bash
    shipwright pipeline start --goal "Add JWT authentication"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Hotfix">
    ```bash
    shipwright pipeline start --issue 456 --pipeline hotfix --test-cmd "pytest"

## Pipeline Templates

| Template     | Stages                                          | Gates                             | Use Case                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `standard`   | intake → plan → build → test → review → PR      | approve: plan, review, pr         | Normal feature work        |
| `fast`       | intake → build → test → PR                      | all auto                          | Quick fixes                |
| `full`       | all 12 stages                                   | approve: plan, review, pr, deploy | Production deployment      |
| `hotfix`     | intake → build → test → PR                      | all auto                          | Urgent production fixes    |
| `autonomous` | all 12 stages                                   | all auto                          | Fully autonomous operation |
| `deployed`   | all 12 stages (incl. deploy, validate, monitor) | approve: deploy                   | Full deploy + monitoring   |
| `enterprise` | all 12 stages                                   | all approve, auto-rollback        | Maximum safety             |
| `cost-aware` | intake → plan → build → test → review → PR      | auto, budget checks               | Budget-limited delivery    |

Browse templates:

```bash
shipwright pipeline list        # List all templates
shipwright pipeline show standard  # View template details
```

## Self-Healing Builds

When tests fail after a build, the pipeline automatically captures the error output and re-enters the build loop with that context — just like a human developer reading test failures and fixing them.

```bash
# Allow up to 3 self-healing cycles
shipwright pipeline start --goal "Build payment flow" --self-heal 3
```

The compound quality stage orchestrates this: it runs tests, and if they fail, feeds the failure output back to the build agent as context for the next iteration.

## GitHub Integration

The pipeline deeply integrates with GitHub when starting from an issue:

- **Auto-fetches** issue title, body, labels, and milestone
- **Self-assigns** the issue to signal work has started
- **Posts progress comments** as stages complete
- **Creates PRs** with labels, milestone, and reviewers propagated from the issue
- **Closes the issue** when the PR is ready

## Auto-Detection

Shipwright automatically detects your project configuration:

- **Test command** — supports 9+ project types (npm, pytest, go test, cargo test, etc.)
- **Branch prefix** — derived from task type (feature/, fix/, hotfix/)
- **Reviewers** — from CODEOWNERS or git history
- **Language and framework** — for context-aware planning

## Managing Pipelines

```bash
# Resume a pipeline from where it left off
shipwright pipeline resume

# Check pipeline progress
shipwright pipeline status

# Abort a running pipeline
shipwright pipeline abort
```

## Notifications

Get notified about pipeline events via webhooks:

```bash
# Slack webhook
shipwright pipeline start --goal "Add auth" --slack-webhook https://hooks.slack.com/...

# Custom webhook (via environment variable)
export SHIPWRIGHT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook.example.com
shipwright pipeline start --goal "Add auth"
```

## Pipeline State

Pipeline progress is tracked in `.claude/pipeline-state.md` and artifacts are stored in `.claude/pipeline-artifacts/`. This allows pipelines to be resumed after interruption.
