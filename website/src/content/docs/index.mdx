## Features

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Agent Teams" icon="group">
    24 templates for the full SDLC. Feature dev, code review, security audit,
    testing, and more. Each agent gets its own tmux pane.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delivery Pipeline" icon="rocket">
    Idea to PR in one command. Self-healing builds, GitHub integration, quality
    gates, and eight pipeline templates.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Intelligence Layer" icon="puzzle">
    AI-powered triage, dynamic pipeline composition, per-stage model routing,
    risk assessment, adversarial code review, and self-optimization.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DORA Metrics" icon="bar-chart">
    Track deployment frequency, cycle time, change failure rate.
    Elite/High/Medium/Low grading based on Google's research.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Repo Preparation" icon="setting">
    Generate `.claude/` configs, `CLAUDE.md`, and hooks. One command to prep any
    repo for autonomous agents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cost Intelligence" icon="information">
    Token usage tracking, daily budgets, and per-stage cost breakdowns.
    Budget-aware auto-scaling keeps spending predictable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Persistent Memory" icon="open-book">
    Agents learn from every pipeline run. Failure patterns, design decisions,
    and codebase conventions carry forward automatically.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Example

```bash
# Start a team session with the feature-dev template
shipwright session my-feature --template feature-dev

# Run a full delivery pipeline from a GitHub issue
shipwright pipeline start --issue 42

# Autonomous development loop with quality gates
shipwright loop "Build auth" --test-cmd "npm test" --audit

# Start the daemon for hands-free issue processing
shipwright daemon start
```

## Why Shipwright?

Shipwright agent teams outperform traditional development workflows in ways that compound over time:

- **24/7 availability** -- no standup meetings, no context switching, no PTO gaps
- **Consistent quality** through compound quality gates that enforce standards on every change
- **Parallel execution** -- three agents building simultaneously across backend, frontend, and tests
- **Intelligent triage** -- AI analyzes issues semantically, not just word counts and label regex
- **Self-improving** -- the system learns from every pipeline run and tunes itself automatically
- **Persistent memory** -- agents learn from every run; humans need onboarding every time
- **Self-healing builds** -- agents read error output and fix failures automatically
- **Predictable cost per issue** vs. salary overhead, benefits, and coordination tax
