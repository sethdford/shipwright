  title: The Autonomous Delivery Platform
  tagline: Label a GitHub issue. Walk away. Shipwright triages with AI, composes an intelligent pipeline, builds with self-healing agents, and creates a PR — learning from every outcome.

## The Full SDLC, Automated

Every stage can be enabled, disabled, or gated. The intelligence layer composes the optimal combination for each issue.

```
intake → plan → design → build → test → review → compound_quality → pr → merge → deploy → validate → monitor
```

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Intelligent Triage" icon="star">
    Claude semantically analyzes every issue — complexity, risk level, success
    probability, optimal template, key risks. Not word counts. Not regex.
    Semantic understanding.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Adaptive Pipelines" icon="puzzle">
    The intelligence engine composes a custom pipeline for each issue. Security
    issues get threat modeling stages. Simple fixes skip planning. Budget
    constraints trigger model downgrades. Static templates remain as fallbacks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Self-Healing Builds" icon="rocket">
    When tests fail, the pipeline captures error output and re-enters the build
    loop with that context. Agents read failures and fix them — just like a
    human developer, but without the frustration.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Adversarial Review" icon="warning">
    After the primary agent writes code, a second adversarial agent tries to
    break it. Security flaws, race conditions, edge cases. They iterate until
    the adversary finds nothing critical.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Developer Simulation" icon="group">
    Before PR submission, three simulated reviewers — security, performance,
    maintainability — raise objections. The agent addresses concerns before any
    human sees the code. Fewer review cycles, faster merges.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Compound Quality" icon="approve-check">
    Multi-dimensional quality audit combining adversarial testing, negative
    testing, end-to-end validation, and definition-of-done verification in a
    single stage. Not just "do tests pass" — does this code actually work.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Intelligence That Compounds

<div class="intel-grid">
  <div class="intel-card">
    <div class="intel-title">Analyze</div>
    <div class="intel-desc">
      Every issue is semantically analyzed for complexity, risk, and optimal
      approach. The intelligence core replaces hardcoded heuristics with
      AI-powered decisions at every branch point in the pipeline.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="intel-card">
    <div class="intel-title">Predict</div>
    <div class="intel-desc">
      Before a pipeline starts, the system estimates cost, predicts which stages
      might fail, and injects preventative context from memory. Anomaly
      detection catches deviations during execution.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="intel-card highlight">
    <div class="intel-title">Learn</div>
    <div class="intel-desc">
      After every pipeline, the self-optimization module analyzes the outcome —
      what worked, what failed, why. Template weights adjust. Model routing
      optimizes. Memory evolves. The next run benefits from every previous one.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Seven modules working together: intelligence core, pipeline composer, self-optimization, predictive analytics, adversarial review, developer simulation, and architecture enforcement. All behind feature flags. All degrade gracefully when disabled.

## One Command

```bash
# Full delivery pipeline — issue to PR, fully autonomous
shipwright pipeline start --issue 42

# Autonomous daemon — watches GitHub, processes issues 24/7
shipwright daemon start

# Team session — 3 agents building in parallel
shipwright session my-feature --template feature-dev

# Continuous loop with quality gates
shipwright loop "Build auth" --test-cmd "npm test" --audit-agent

# Fleet — daemons across every repo in your organization
shipwright fleet start

# Apply the same fix across 10 repos simultaneously
shipwright fix "Update lodash to 4.17.21" --repos ~/api,~/web,~/mobile
```

## The Platform

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Delivery Pipeline" icon="rocket">
    12-stage pipeline from intake to monitoring. Self-healing builds, GitHub
    integration, quality gates, and eight templates — from fast hotfixes to
    enterprise deployments with auto-rollback.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Autonomous Daemon" icon="setting">
    Background process that polls GitHub for labeled issues, triages with AI,
    spawns pipelines, retries failures with escalation, and optimizes itself
    based on DORA metrics. Set it and forget it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Agent Teams" icon="group">
    24 team templates covering the full SDLC — feature development, code review,
    security audit, testing, refactoring, migration, incident response, and
    more. Each agent gets its own tmux pane with strict file ownership.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fleet Operations" icon="list-format">
    Orchestrate daemons across every repository in your organization from a
    single command. Shared worker pools, aggregate DORA metrics, and fleet-wide
    dashboards.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DORA Metrics" icon="bar-chart">
    Track deployment frequency, cycle time, change failure rate, and mean time
    to recovery. Elite/High/Medium/Low grading based on Google's research. The
    self-optimizer uses these metrics to tune the system automatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cost Intelligence" icon="information">
    Token usage tracking per stage, daily budget enforcement, and per-issue cost
    breakdowns. The intelligence layer predicts costs before runs and routes
    cheaper models to simpler stages. Budget-aware auto-scaling.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Persistent Memory" icon="open-book">
    Failure patterns, design decisions, codebase conventions, and performance
    baselines — captured after every run and injected into future pipelines.
    Cross-repo global memory shares learnings across projects.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Architecture Enforcement" icon="document">
    A living architectural model built from your codebase. Every change is
    validated against established patterns. Violations are flagged before PR
    creation. The model evolves when legitimate changes are detected.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
