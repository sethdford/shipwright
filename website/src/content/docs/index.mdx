## Features

  <Card title="Agent Teams" icon="group">
    12 templates for the full SDLC. Feature dev, code review, security audit, testing, and more. Each agent gets its own tmux pane.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delivery Pipeline" icon="rocket">
    Idea to PR in one command. Self-healing builds, GitHub integration, quality gates, and five pipeline templates.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DORA Metrics" icon="bar-chart">
    Track deployment frequency, cycle time, change failure rate. Elite/High/Medium/Low grading based on Google's research.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Repo Preparation" icon="setting">

## Quick Example

```bash
# Start a team session with the feature-dev template
cct session my-feature --template feature-dev

# Run a full delivery pipeline from a GitHub issue
cct pipeline start --issue 42

# Autonomous development loop with quality gates
cct loop "Build auth" --test-cmd "npm test" --audit

# Start the daemon for hands-free issue processing
cct daemon start
```

## Why Shipwright?

Claude Code's agent teams let you spawn multiple AI agents that work in parallel — one on backend, one on frontend, one writing tests. Shipwright gives you the infrastructure to run them effectively:

- **Premium dark tmux theme** with agent-aware pane borders
- **Quality gate hooks** that block agents until code passes checks
- **Autonomous loops** that iterate until tests pass
- **Pipeline automation** from issue intake to PR creation
- **DORA metrics** to track your team's delivery performance
