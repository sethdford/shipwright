title: Team Templates
description: All 12 team templates covering the full SDLC — from feature development to security audits.
---

Shipwright includes 12 team templates organized by SDLC phase. Each template defines the agent roles, their focus areas, and the files they should own. Browse templates with `cct templates list` and view details with `cct templates show <name>`.

## Build Phase

### Feature Development (`feature-dev`) — 3 agents

| Agent | Focus | Example Files |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **backend** | API routes, services, data layer | `src/api/`, `src/services/` |
| **frontend** | UI components, state, styling | `apps/web/src/` |
| **tests** | Unit tests, integration tests | `*.test.ts` |

**Best for:** Multi-layer features where frontend, backend, and tests can be developed in parallel.

### Full-Stack (`full-stack`) — 3 agents

| Agent | Focus | Example Files |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **api** | REST/GraphQL endpoints, middleware, auth | `src/api/`, `src/routes/` |
| **database** | Schema, migrations, queries, models | `migrations/`, `prisma/` |
| **ui** | Pages, components, forms, styling | `apps/web/`, `src/components/` |

**Best for:** Features that span the entire stack from database to UI.

## Quality Phase

### Code Review (`code-review`) — 3 agents

| Agent | Focus | What It Checks |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **code-quality** | Logic, patterns, architecture | Bugs, code smells, layer violations |
| **security** | Error handling, injection, auth | OWASP top 10, silent failures |
| **test-coverage** | Test completeness, edge cases | Missing tests, weak assertions |

**Best for:** Thorough review of PRs or feature branches.

### Security Audit (`security-audit`) — 3 agents

| Agent | Focus | What It Checks |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **code-analysis** | SAST: injection, auth, XSS, CSRF | Source code vulnerabilities |
| **dependencies** | CVEs, outdated packages, licenses | Supply chain risks |
| **config-review** | Secrets, CORS, CSP, env config | Infrastructure security |

**Best for:** Pre-release security reviews and compliance checks.

### Comprehensive Testing (`testing`) — 3 agents

| Agent | Focus | What It Covers |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **unit-tests** | Functions, classes, modules | Isolated unit tests |
| **integration-tests** | API endpoints, service interactions | Cross-component tests |
| **e2e-tests** | User flows, UI interactions | Full system tests |

**Best for:** Test coverage campaigns and test suite creation.

## Maintenance Phase

### Bug Fix (`bug-fix`) — 3 agents

| Agent | Focus | What It Does |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **reproducer** | Write failing test, trace root cause | Proves the bug exists |
| **fixer** | Fix source code, handle edge cases | Implements the fix |
| **verifier** | Regression check, review changes | Ensures nothing else breaks |

**Best for:** Complex bugs that need reproduction, fix, and verification.

### Refactoring (`refactor`) — 2 agents

| Agent | Focus | What It Does |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **refactor** | Source code changes | Rename, restructure, extract |
| **consumers** | Tests and dependents | Update imports, fix tests, verify |

**Best for:** Large-scale code transformations with strict file ownership.

### Migration (`migration`) — 3 agents

| Agent | Focus | What It Does |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **schema** | Migration scripts, data transforms | Write the migration |
| **adapter** | Update app code, queries, models | Adapt to new schema |
| **rollback** | Rollback scripts, backward compat | Verify safe reversal |

**Best for:** Database migrations and schema changes that need forward and rollback paths.

## Planning Phase

### Architecture (`architecture`) — 2 agents

| Agent | Focus | What It Does |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **researcher** | Analyze code, trace deps, evaluate trade-offs | Deep codebase analysis |
| **spec-writer** | ADRs, design docs, interface contracts | Write technical specs |

**Best for:** Pre-implementation research and architecture decision records.

### Exploration (`exploration`) — 2 agents

| Agent | Focus | What It Does |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **explorer** | Deep-dive code, trace execution paths | Map the codebase |
| **synthesizer** | Summarize findings, document patterns | Distill insights |

**Best for:** Onboarding onto unfamiliar codebases and understanding complex systems.

## Operations Phase

### DevOps (`devops`) — 2 agents

| Agent | Focus | What It Does |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **pipeline** | CI/CD workflows, build, deploy | GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc. |
| **infrastructure** | Docker, Terraform, K8s, env config | Infrastructure as code |

**Best for:** CI/CD setup, deployment automation, and infrastructure changes.

### Documentation (`documentation`) — 2 agents

| Agent | Focus | What It Does |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **api-docs** | API reference, OpenAPI spec, examples | Endpoint documentation |
| **guides** | Tutorials, README, architecture docs | User-facing docs |

**Best for:** Documentation sprints and API reference generation.

## Using Templates

```bash
# List all available templates
cct templates list

# View template details
cct templates show feature-dev

# Create a session with a template
cct session my-feature --template feature-dev
```

Templates live in `tmux/templates/` as JSON files. You can create custom templates by copying an existing one and modifying the agent definitions.
